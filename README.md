Introduction
------------

This is a React Native project that displays a list of users and their associated albums. The project uses the `react-native` library to create a native mobile app, and the `redux` library to manage application state.

Components
------------

The following components are used in the project:

* `Section`: A component that wraps the `Text` component and displays a title and description.
* `UserList`: A component that displays a list of users.
* `PhotoGrid`: A component that displays an album of photos.

Functions
------------

The following functions are defined in the project:

* `fetchUsersAsync`: An asynchronous function that fetches a list of users from an API.
* `fetchAlbumsAsync`: An asynchronous function that fetches a list of albums for each user from an API.
* `setUserList`: A reducer function that sets the `users` state to the list of users returned by the `fetchUsersAsync` function.
* `setUserAlbums`: A reducer function that sets the `albums` state to the list of albums returned by the `fetchAlbumsAsync` function for each user.

Reducers
------------

The following reducers are defined in the project:

* `usersReducer`: A reducer function that handles state for the list of users.
* `albumsReducer`: A reducer function that handles state for the list of albums.

Store
-------

The project uses the `configureStore` function from the `reduxjs` library to create a store with the following reducers:

* `usersReducer`: A reducer function that handles state for the list of users.
* `albumsReducer`: A reducer function that handles state for the list of albums.

Thunks
-------

The project defines the following thunks:

* `fetchUsersAsync`: An asynchronous thunk that fetches a list of users from an API.
* `fetchAlbumsAsync`: An asynchronous thunk that fetches a list of albums for each user from an API.

* `fetchAllPhotosAsync`: An asynchronous thunk that fetches a list of photos for all albums from an API.
* `fetchPhotosByAlbumIdAsync`: An asynchronous thunk that fetches a list of photos for a specific album from an API.



Actions
----------

The project defines the following actions:

* `setUserList`: An action that sets the `users` state to the list of users returned by the `fetchUsersAsync` function.
* `setUserAlbums`: An action that sets the `albums` state to the list of albums returned by the `fetchAlbumsAsync` function for each user.
* `setAllPhotos`: An action that sets the `allphotos` state to the list of photos returned by the `fetchAllPhotosAsync` function.
* `setCurrentAlbum`: An action that sets the `currentAlbum` state to the album returned by the `fetchPhotosByAlbumIdAsync` function.
* `toggleDisplayMode`: An action that toggles the display mode of the photos (whether to show all photos or the current album).


Selectors
------------

The project defines the following selectors:

* `selectUsers`: A selector that returns the list of users.
* `selectUserAlbums`: A selector that returns the list of albums for each user.
* `selectAllPhotos`: A selector that returns the list of photos for all albums.
* `selectCurrentAlbum`: A selector that returns the album currently being displayed.

App
------

The project exports a single component, `App`, which renders the `Section` component with the `UserList` and `PhotoGrid` components as children. The `App` component also uses the `store` function to create a store with the `usersReducer` and `albumsReducer` 
reducers.

Conclusion
----------

This project is a basic example of how to use React Native and Redux together to build a mobile app that displays a list of users and their associated albums. Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to building complex applications with React 
Native and Redux, but hopefully this documentation will give you a good starting point for your own project.
